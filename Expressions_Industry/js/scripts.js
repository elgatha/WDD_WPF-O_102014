//Problem: given a job and number of hours worked, how many hours until technically becoming awesome at being a Chef?

//"Awesomeness" inspired by Jack Black in Kung Fu Panda because my youngest niece is 3 years old and loves it and I'm stuck babysitting

//name of job
var skill = prompt('What skill did you practice to be an Amazing Chef  For example - "Knife Skills","Education" or "Training"');

//number of years working body into the ground
var yearsWorked = parseInt(prompt('How many years did I spend actively as a Chef (numeric)?'));

//get number of hours worked per week that you can barely stand
var avgHoursPerWeek = parseInt(prompt('How many hours per week did you work (numeric)?'));
